### Cursor Rules — Last Lighthouse

#### Progress Tracking (every message)
- Always start with a brief Progress Update (1–3 sentences): what just happened, what’s next, and any blockers/risks.
- When a multi-step change is underway, maintain a lightweight TODO list and check items off immediately upon completion.
- Keep updates concise and action-focused.

#### Resolve Vagueness by Checking Required Documents First
- Before asking the user for clarification, consult project documents in this order:
  1. `README.md`
  2. `docs/GAME_DESIGN.md`
  3. `docs/TECHNICAL_SPEC.md`
  4. `docs/ART_GUIDE.md`
  5. `docs/BALANCING_NOTES.md`
  6. `project.godot` and the `scenes/` and `scripts/` directories for canonical references
- If still unclear, ask 1–2 targeted questions and propose a safe, clearly stated assumption to keep momentum.

#### Project Conventions
- Engine: Godot 4.x. Prefer GDScript unless a strong reason exists otherwise.
- Follow README architecture principles: heavy use of Signals, composition over inheritance, modular systems, minimal Autoloads.
- Adhere to naming and clarity guidelines shown in `README.md` (e.g., descriptive identifiers, enums for states).

#### Code & Edit Hygiene
- Match existing formatting and preserve indentation style; do not reformat unrelated code.
- Only add comments for non-obvious rationale, invariants, or edge cases.
- Keep changes scoped; avoid broad refactors unless requested.

#### Commands & Environment
- Use `python3` (not `python`) when running Python commands.
- Treat `README.md` as the primary source of truth for gameplay/architecture; prefer `docs/*` for deeper details when present.

#### Message Structure (for clarity)
- Progress Update → Answer/Edits → Short summary of impact.
- Be concise by default; expand details only when necessary (or when asked).
